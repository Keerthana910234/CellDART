Description: CellDART estimates the spatial distribution of cells defined by single-cell level data using domain adaptation of neural networks. The neural network that predicts the cell proportion in a pseudospot, a virtual mixture of cells from single-cell data, is translated to decompose the cell types in each spatial barcoded region.
